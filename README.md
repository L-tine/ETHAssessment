This Solidity smart contract project implements a token system named MyToken, allowing for token creation (minting) and destruction (burning), while also keeping track of token balances for addresses.

The contract features public variables such as tokenName, tokenAbbrv, and totalSupply to store token details, along with a mapping called balances to manage token balances for addresses.

It provides a mint function for creating new tokens and assigning them to designated addresses. Additionally, there's a burn function to eliminate tokens, reducing both the total supply and the balance of a specific address.
